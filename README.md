## Development

To start development, follow these steps:

## Use node version v8.9.4

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

This fires up the development server on port `3000`.

You can now choose to either start developing your react application or
to enhance the express server according to your needs.

The react app's entry point is `src/shared/App.js` and the express
server is started from `src/index.js`.
